Start the Game:

Display "Players stand!" to indicate the start of the game.
Set a Random Timer:

Generate a random number between 10 and 25 seconds for the game duration.
Store this random time as sleep_time.
Initialize an Empty List:

Create an empty list called sit_down_list to keep track of players who sit down.
Prompt Players to Sit:

Inform players that they can sit down within the random duration.
Continuously prompt the user to enter the name of the player who sits down.
Add each entered name to the sit_down_list.
End the Prompt When Time's Up:

While the program waits for the random sleep_time, allow players to keep entering names.
If the user types "done", stop prompting for input.
Display "Time's Up":

After the random sleep duration ends, display "Time's Up!".
Determine the Winner:

Check if there are any players in the sit_down_list.
If the list is not empty, declare the last person entered as the winner.
If the list is empty (no one sat down), declare that everyone is eliminated.
End the Game:

Print the winnerâ€™s name if there is a winner, or announce that no one sat down.
Detailed Steps:
Print "Players stand!".
Set sleep_time = random.randint(10, 25).
Create an empty list sit_down_list = [].
Print instructions: Inform players that they have between 10 and 25 seconds to sit down.
Start a loop:
Ask for player names while time.sleep_time is counting down.
Append player names to sit_down_list.
Break the loop if the user types "done".
After sleep_time:
Print "Time's Up!".
Check if sit_down_list is not empty:
If it contains names, print the last name in the list as the winner.
If it is empty, print that everyone is eliminated.
