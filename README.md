# Timer Game
### MGTC28
How to Play
Players Stand: At the start, all players stand up.
Random Timer: A random timer between 10 and 25 seconds is set.
Players Sit: During this time, players can choose to sit down. They must enter their names into the program as they sit.
Time’s Up: Once the timer expires, the game announces “Time’s Up!”.
Winner: The last player to sit down wins. Any player still standing at the end is eliminated.
Game Rules
Players can sit at any time before the timer runs out.
The last person to sit wins.
If no players sit, everyone is eliminated.
Additional Note:
There was uncertainty during development on whether an image should be displayed when the timer expires. The current implementation prints "Time's Up!" but could be modified to display a meme or image instead.
